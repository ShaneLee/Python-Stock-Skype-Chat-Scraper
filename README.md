# Python-Stock-Skype-Chat-Scraper
This is a web scraper which allows the user to enter a stock ticker and receive via Skype a series of recent forum posts about the stock entered. 

In Skype.Py you will need to enter your skype username on line 9, your skype password on line 10, and the contact which you would like to send the stock data to on line 14.
